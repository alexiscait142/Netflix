# Movie Finder

This CLI app is used to recommend movies to users.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites and Installing

All of the gems are already in the Gemfile, so you only need to run this command

```
bundle install
```
in the terminal to add them.

### Running the CLI

To start the program, type:

```
ruby runner.rb
```

in the terminal and follow the prompts!

You will be able to choose a username, find a movie and see various information about the movie and add it to your watchlist. You can also delete movies from your watchlist.
